# Mimic Engine (C++)

Mimic is a C++ rudamentary game engine which aims to explore the inner</br> 
workings of modern day game engines (e.g. Unity, Unreal and Godot). Mimic implements numerous</br>
techniques such as the CMake build system, entity-component Systems (ECS), resource management, simple,</br>
physics, OpenGL graphics, and libraries (e.g. ImGUI) to create a practical game, demonstrating the</br>
engine's core functionality.

Made using a variety of libraries and systems: CMake, ImGUI, GLEW, OpenGL, SDL2, assimp. </br>
Submitted as an assignment in my final year at Bournemouth University (2024). </br>
